-- Goal: change the query from using a subquery to using a Common Table Expression (CTE)

-- Original Query
SELECT SUM(salary), ROUND(AVG(salary),2)
FROM employees AS e2
WHERE e2.region_id in (SELECT id
                       FROM company_regions AS cr
                       WHERE region_name LIKE '%east%');
                       

-- Rewritten Query
WITH east_regions AS
    (SELECT id FROM company_regions AS cr WHERE cr.region_name LIKE '%east%')
SELECT SUM(salary), ROUND(AVG(salary),2)
FROM employees AS e2
WHERE e2.region_id IN east_regions; 

-- Another solution
WITH east_regions AS
    (SELECT id FROM company_regions AS cr WHERE cr.region_name LIKE '%east%')
SELECT SUM(e2.salary), ROUND(AVG(e2.salary),2)
FROM employees AS e2
JOIN east_regions AS er ON e2.region_id = er.id;
