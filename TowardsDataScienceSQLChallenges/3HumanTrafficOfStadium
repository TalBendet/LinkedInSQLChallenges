-- Goal: write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive rows with the amount of people greater than or equal to 100

-- Solution: identify which rows fit the criteria by assigning a unique streak_id for each time the first row
--     of over 100 was hit after rows of less than 100 (done by using the row id subtracted by the row number.
--     Then, compute the totals of each streak by counting by streak id, and then filtering for those counts that were 3 or greater
