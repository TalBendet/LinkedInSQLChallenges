-- Goal: Update an existing customer record
    
UPDATE Customers SET Address = "74 Pine St.", City = "New York", State = "NY" WHERE CustomerID = (
    SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers
    WHERE FirstName = 'Taylor' AND LastName = 'Jenkins' AND Address LIKE "%27170 6th Center%");
    
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE FirstName = 'Taylor' AND LastName = 'Jenkins' AND Address LIKE "74 Pine St."; 

-- Another way to do is to store the CustomerID in a variable to reduce redundancy of queries
-- Can't do on SQLite as it doesn't support variables
