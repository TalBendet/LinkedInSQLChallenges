-- Goal: Write a query to report animals and their vaccination status
-- Include animals that have not been vaccinated
-- The report should show the animal's name, species, breed, primary color,
--      vaccination time, vaccine name, staff member's first name, last name, role
-- Use the minimal number of tables required
-- Use the correct logical join types and force join order as needed
