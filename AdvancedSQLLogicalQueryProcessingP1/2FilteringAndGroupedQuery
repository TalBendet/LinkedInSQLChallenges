-- Goal: Write a query to report the number of vaccinations each animal has received. Include animals that were never vaccinated
-- Exclude rabbits, rabies vaccines, and animals that were last vaccinated on or after October 1, 2019
-- The report should show the animals name, species, primary color, breed, and the number of vaccinations
-- Use the correct logical join types and force order if necessary
-- Use the correct logical group by expression

SELECT a.name, a.species, a.primary_color, a.breed, COUNT(v.vaccine) AS "Count of Vaccines"
FROM animals AS a
LEFT JOIN vaccinations AS v
ON a.name = v.name AND a.species = v.species
WHERE a.species != 'Rabbit' AND (v.vaccine != 'Rabies' OR v.vaccine IS NULL)
GROUP BY a.name, a.species
HAVING (MAX(DATE(v.vaccination_time)) < '2019-10-01' OR MAX(DATE(v.vaccination_time)) IS NULL)
ORDER BY "Count of Vaccines" DESC;

-- Another solution
SELECT a.species,
	   a.name,
	   MAX(a.primary_color) AS Primary_Color, -- Dummy aggregate
	   MAX(a.breed) AS Breed, -- Dummy aggregate
	   COUNT(v.vaccine), COUNT(*)
FROM animals AS a
LEFT JOIN
	Vaccinations AS v
	ON v.name = a.name AND v.species = a.species
WHERE a.species != 'Rabbit' AND (v.vaccine != 'Rabies' OR v.vaccine IS NULL)
GROUP BY a.species, a.name
HAVING (MAX(DATE(v.vaccination_time)) < '2019-10-01' OR MAX(DATE(v.vaccination_time)) IS NULL)
ORDER BY a.species, a.name

-- Both solutions return the same output. The difference is that the second solution uses dummy aggregates for fields
--      that were not included in the group by clause
